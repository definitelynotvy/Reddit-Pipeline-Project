1czh51d,Need Advice - Recently joined company as a Senior Data Engineer but BI Manager refusing to give me permissions on Snowflake.,"I recently joined a company as a Senior Data Engineer and have 6+ years in the field. We are working with AWS and Snowflake. I am working along side (but not under) the BI team who have a combination of 6-8 DEs, analysts, etc. I am in my first two weeks, but already have hit roadblocks where I am explicitly not given permissions to create stage integrations to data lakes or to create/use stages in snowflake. This feels weird to not be able to have these permissions and it’s directly impacting my tickets. My manager and skip level are aware but not much is being done.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation? I have unsuccessfully tried to reason with the BI manager that I need these permissions. Should I be patient as it’s just been 2 weeks and I need to earn more trust? Appreciate any advice here

1d0127x,Should data pipelines be agnostic on data size?,"So I have a question that maybe I am overthinking.

Imagine a basic data pipeline in python that reads data from a sql table and writes it somewhere else, like a data lake. In this case, I normally would do ""SELECT \* FROM table"" to a pandas dataframe and write the file where I want it. My question is: am I doing it right?

This way, I think it's faster, with data capable of being processed in the machine it's running. But for bigger data I should probably process it in chunks. Are there any best practices I am missing? What if the pipeline breaks because of data growth? All the material I read is very high level concepts and doesn't really help with things like this (except Learning Spark which has code examples).

1czxxtn,"Europe DE with 5yoe, what next ?","
I'm 29 yo and I have been a DE in Europe for almost 5 years now and I would like your opinion.
First a bit of background.
I have worked for 2 companies

First one: worked 3 years, adtech company. My job was to write ETL pipelines in python and a bit of pyspark. We were running Airflow on K8, which I had to deploy and maintain myself. Everything was on GCP. Also had to provide help and infra (Airflow) for data scientists. Did a bit of web dev also, a website that was used internally to run some ML jobs on demand. I was the only DE in the team.

Second one: an e-commerce company, again everything is on GCP. ETL using pyspark only and modelisation in Looker. A bit of no code stuff like Fivetran but not much.
A bit of streaming with Redpanda and Benthos. Again we have to deploy everything ourselves. This time we are 3 DE and my manager is a DE himself

My goal now is to change company and to grab a better salary at the same time. I'm currently at 60k and I think even though its Europe, I might get a better salary.

My question are:

- what could i work on/ improve that could make my profile more attractive to recruiter ? I've never worked with dbt/snowflake for example, could it be worth it to spend some time on it ?

- how important is still pyspark ? I have room for improvement, is it worth it to work on this ?
- any tips to maximize salary in Europe as a DE ? Look for remote job with a company oversas ?",7,0,Fit-Needleworker6411,2024-05-24 23:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1czxxtn/europe_de_with_5yoe_what_next/,False,False,False,False
1czx52s,Relational Data Modeling Question,"Background: I've built application data models in the past.  I've built several star schemas in the past 10 years.  Now I have an project in a 3-layer data warehouse environment (staging/relational/star).

Question: In a relational model for a data warehouse that will be large and maintained by multiple teams, which approach is preferred and why?

1. Three big super-type tables with a bunch of sub-types each, with all relationships between those super-types.  Subtypes will only relate to the super-type tables.
2. Three big super-type tables with a bunch of sub-types each, but the subtypes will have many other relationships between each other based on the business logic.  Super-types might have some master hierarchy, but the sub-types will have most of the relationships.

1 Pros: Super flexible relationships, everything will be hierarchies and many to many.  Centralized model will give economy of scale over time for devs.  Less tables and relationships.  Con: Higher overall complexity.

2 Pros: Easy for a less technical audience to understand and use.  Specific relationships enforce logic.  Allow separate project teams to manage 95% of their sub-models independently.

1 Mitigate: Could create views for certain sub-types to simplify use, or just direct people to the star schema layer.  Cardinality data quality rules can be written and run in batch to ensure specific relationships.  Document sub-type relationships (should the logical model have these relationships?).

2 Mitigate: Still have master tables to bring everything together in the star if some use case requires it.  Enforce data modeling standards and create a library for reusable designs.

1czrqrc,Recommendations for books/articles/learning resources,"Hi everyone! 

I was recently offered a position as a systems- and solution architect within data and analytics, where the company is working towards transitioning into cloud (Azure). 

I am curious if the architects out there have some recommendations on litterature or other sources of learning that you have found useful or interesting? It doesnt have to be strictly architecture-related and can be on topics that you think are useful to have some knowledge about in such a position. 

In order to put my knowledge level in context:
I have no previous experience working as an architect but have worked as a data engineer for some years and prior to that i worked as a researcher, which involved quite a lot of data science. So I have a rather broad (if not deep) knowledge of technical areas within BI, ML, data(warehousing/lakes) and analytical solutions and systems.

I also hope that some of the architects out there can share some tricks to succeed in such a position as well!

1czxptz,Tips for ensuring data quality in microservice architecture?,"Tips for ensuring data quality in microservice architecture?

**The context:**

I am working on an ML project where we are pulling tabular data from surveys in an IOS app, and then sending that data to different GCP services, including big query, cloud functions, pub sub, and cloud run. At a high-level, we have a event-driven architecture which is triggered each time a new survey is filled out, then it will check if all the data is completed to run the model, and if so, it will make a call to the ML API which is in cloud run. The ML API calls upon big query to create the vectors for the model, and the finally makes a prediction, which is sent back to firebase, which can be accessed by the IOS app.

**The challenge:**

As you all know, ML data going into the model must be ""perfect"" meaning all data types have to match how they were in the original model, columns have to be in the same order, null values must be treated the same etc... The challenge I am having is I want to audit the data from point A to B, so from using the app on my phone and entering data to making predictions. What I have found is this is a surprisingly difficult and manual process where I am basically recording my input data manually then adding print statements in all these different cloud environments, and verifying back and forth from the original inputted data, as it travels and gets transformed.

**The question:**

**How have others been able to ensure confidence in the data entering their models when it is passed amongst many different services and environments?**

How can I do this in a more programmatic and automated way? I feel like even if I can get through the tedious process of verifying for a single user and their vector, it still doesn't feel very complete. Some ideas that come to mind are writing data tests and adding human-readable logging statements at every point of data transfer.",3,2,mle-questions,2024-05-24 22:53:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1czxptz/tips_for_ensuring_data_quality_in_microservice/,False,False,False,False

1d06eoa,"Can't stand my current company...Try to find another ""SQL Developer"" gig and jump ship? Or try to hang on and see if I can catch up on data engineering stuff and shift to a new career path?","So, maybe this isn't the right place to be asking about this, but I often see career posts, so maybe it's okay. This is also probably going to be a venting post because I don't have many people I can talk to about this. I talk to my girlfriend, but she doesn't work in tech, so most of it goes over her head and she can't relate to the issues I'm running into.

I'm in a bit of weird place in my career right now....I'm in my early 30's, and I've been a SQL developer (specifically SQL Server) for the last 12 years or so. And when I say ""SQL Developer"" I mean that pretty strictly.

I was at my last company for about 10 years where I learned SQL, and worked my way up to Sr. SQL Developer. Toward the end, I started working quite a bit in C# as well...but I could tell I hit a salary ceiling there. If I wanted to make more money, I had to leave despite how much I enjoyed working there. So 2 years ago, I left.

My new company started off great, interviews were fantastic and made the company sound incredible...but now having been there for 2 years...I cannot stand it. There's a lot of problems with how they get work done, they constantly kill my projects half way in. I was there nearly 18 months before I commit my first line of production code. They're a fairly large and fairly old company. I think they're stuck in their old school ways of doing things, but they're trying to implement more modern practices and it's not going well, and the VP's of my department are impossible to work with....Suffice to say...I need to leave.

My girlfriend can tell that this job is slowly sucking the life out of me. It's making me hate what I do for a living, and the one thing that made me good at my job was my passion for the work, which is now pretty much gone. I'm constantly depressed and mentally exhausted because of this job.

90% of my experience is in T-SQL development (no DBA skills). And in my opinion...dedicated SQL developer jobs are dying off. The majority of job postings I see, SQL is a skill listed, not the entire role.  
  
So this is my conundrum...If I want to find a new job *right now*, it will likely have to be another ""SQL developer"" job. Which from what I've found so far, there aren't that many, and they typically aren't paying as much as I'm making now (\~$140k USD + 3% annual bonus + 4% 401k match + benefits); And at the same time...I don't think I want to continue down this path of being just a ""SQL developer"", that doesn't seem good for my career future.

So now I'm trying to decide between....do I take the first SQL developer job I can manage to get just so I can get away from this company? Maybe I'll get lucky and find a company willing to embrace my passion to learn new skills and let me take on junior level projects outside the scope of being a SQL developer. That was a huge perk of my previous company and was hoping I'd have more opportunities like that at my new one.  
  
OR, do I try to hang on to my current job, deal with hating it there while I try to learn some data engineering tools, languages, etc, and see if maybe I can get a job in data engineering and make that my new career path?

It just feels like a crappy situation...stay at the job I hate and hope I can learn new skills that will land me a job in a new field I may or may not like. OR keep on with my current career path which seems to be dropping in demand.",2,0,outatime__,2024-05-25 07:13:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1d06eoa/cant_stand_my_current_companytry_to_find_another/,False,False,False,False
